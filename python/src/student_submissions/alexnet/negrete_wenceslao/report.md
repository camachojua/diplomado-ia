# AlexNet Implementation Report

## Overview

This report details the implementation and comparison of two approaches to using AlexNet for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset:

1. A custom implementation of AlexNet
2. A pre-trained AlexNet model fine-tuned for CIFAR-10

### Hardware Configuration

The experiments were conducted using CUDA-enabled GPU hardware, which significantly accelerated the training process. This is evidenced by the device selection in both implementations: `device='cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'`

### CIFAR-10 Dataset Overview

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 distinct classes:

- 50,000 training images
- 10,000 test images
- Classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck
- Each class contains exactly 6,000 images

## Implementation Details

### Dataset

Both implementations used the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The data was preprocessed in the following ways:

- Custom AlexNet:

  - Images resized to 224x224
  - Basic normalization with mean (0.5) and std (0.5)
  - Batch size of 32

- Pre-trained AlexNet:
  - Images resized to 227x227
  - More robust data augmentation including:
    - Random cropping with padding
    - Random horizontal flips
  - ImageNet standard normalization (mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
  - Larger batch size of 64
  - Pin memory enabled for better GPU utilization

### Image Resizing Rationale

The decision to resize CIFAR-10 images from 32x32 to larger dimensions was necessary for several reasons:

1. AlexNet's Original Architecture:

   - AlexNet was originally designed for ImageNet dataset with 224x224 input images
   - The network's architecture, particularly the convolutional layers and filter sizes, was optimized for larger input dimensions
   - Maintaining similar spatial dimensions helps preserve the network's learning capacity

2. Different Resize Dimensions:

   - Custom Implementation (224x224): Chosen to match the standard ImageNet input size
   - Pre-trained Version (227x227): Selected to match the specific pre-trained model's requirements
   - The slight difference (224 vs 227) comes from historical implementations of AlexNet and different framework defaults

3. Impact on Feature Learning:

   - Larger input dimensions allow the network to learn more fine-grained features
   - Multiple pooling layers in AlexNet require sufficient input size to prevent excessive information loss
   - Resizing helps maintain the aspect ratio while providing enough spatial information for feature extraction

4. Trade-offs:
   - Upscaling increases computational cost
   - Benefits of matching architectural design outweigh potential drawbacks like a huge increase in RAM and VRAM utilization

### Architecture Modifications

Both implementations adapted the original AlexNet architecture to work with CIFAR-10:

1. Custom AlexNet:

   - Modified convolutional layers with smaller filters and strides
   - Adjusted the fully connected layers to handle the resized input
   - Final layer modified for 10 classes (CIFAR-10)

2. Pre-trained AlexNet:
   - Used the standard torchvision AlexNet architecture
   - Only modified the final classifier layer to output 10 classes
   - Leveraged pre-trained weights from ImageNet

### Training Configuration

Common training parameters for both implementations:

- Optimizer: SGD with momentum (0.9)
- Learning rate: 0.01
- Weight decay: 5e-4
- Learning rate scheduling: CosineAnnealingLR
- Number of epochs: 5
- Loss function: CrossEntropyLoss

### Memory Management and Batch Processing

The implementations incorporated several memory optimization strategies:

1. Batch Size Selection:

   - Custom AlexNet: Smaller batch size (32) to manage memory with larger image dimensions
   - Pre-trained AlexNet: Larger batch size (64) leveraging optimized architecture

2. Memory Optimizations:
   - Pin memory enabled for faster GPU transfers
   - Gradient calculations performed in-place where possible
   - Proper cleanup of gradients with optimizer.zero_grad()
   - DataLoader workers (num_workers=2) for efficient data loading

## Results

Both models were trained for 5 epochs and evaluated on the test set. The training process included:

- Batch-wise training with loss computation
- Learning rate adjustment using cosine annealing
- Regular accuracy monitoring
- Training time tracking per epoch

### Performance Comparison

The pre-trained AlexNet demonstrated superior performance:

- Higher final test accuracy (94.30% vs 91.05%)
- Faster convergence in training
- Better starting point due to ImageNet pre-training
- More stable training progression
